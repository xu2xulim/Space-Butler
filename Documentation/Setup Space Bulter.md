## Instructions
After you select to install Space Butler from Space Discovery a couple of Space Butler will appear on your canvas :
- click on the 3 dots of Space Butler
- click on "Settings"
- click on "Configuration"
- Copy and paste your Trello API Key and Token and save the information provided

For instructions on how to create your API and Token follow this [link](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/#your-first-api-call)

At this point, if you go to View Data, you will probably not see a copy of your API Key and Token stored in a Deta Base "space_butler_config".
A copy will be created and subsquently updated should you decide to change either the API Key and/or Token.
